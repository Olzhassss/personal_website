<section class="pt-0"><div class="mx-auto container text-lg [&_h2]:mb-2 [&_p]:mb-4 [&_em]:italic"><h2>Dear reader!</h2>
<p>In this blog, I am going to look at a famous manga - Tokyo Ghoul by Sui Ishida - from a perspective of rhetorical and design analysis. I will be specifically focusing on chapter 53 of Tokyo Ghoul: Re (the sequel aka part 2) because the entirety of this story counts 323 chapters of content that is impossible neither to comprehend nor to explain in details. But let’s first explore what manga is.</p>
<p class="text-base"><em>Side note:</em> I will be using English localization available online. English localization is done by amateurs. I could not find the original version of the pages, therefore I can only analyze text as is edited by the localizators. Unlike them, the original text likely looks (and feels) more natural and expressive.
</p>
<p class="text-base"><em>Side note 2:</em> Sui Ishida is the author of the story, but, in fact, manga is made by him and his assistant artists. I will address Sui as the single author for simplicity.
</p>
<h2>What’s manga? Genre conventions and design elements</h2>
<div class="ml-4 max-w-[30%] float-right"><img src="/personal_website/images/page_6.jpg" alt="one page from the chapter" class="border h-full">
    <p class="text-center text-base">First page of the chapter as an example</p></div>
<p>Manga, to put it simply, is a Japanese version of American comic books. It is a form of entertainment, writing and visual art. If to look at it from the genre perspective, manga is obviously a subgenre of the comic genre. Here are some genre conventions to distinguish manga from other genres:</p>
<ul class="svelte-cnyx57"><li>As a form of comic, manga is built on frames – its fundamental design elements.</li>
<li>There are text balloons, captions and plain text that express sounds, voices, thoughts and other elements.</li>
<li>Main elements are made by drawing with ink and brush (on paper or digitally). Somewhat unlike American comic book genre, manga is mostly black and white.</li>
<li>Manga chapters are read right-to-left, top-down (printed books also start from the “last” page, from a western point of view).</li>
<li>Some decorations, backgrounds and shadows are applied with screentones (link).</li>
<li>In text, ellipses usually mean silence, not omission of something.</li></ul>
<p>Although frame is the fundamental content block of manga, it is common to see content “outside” frames – in such cases the page (or entire two-page spread!) becomes the frame. Speech balloons (another basic element) also can be used in a great variety of forms and functions. Like every comic, manga utilizes non-standard fonts and writing styles. Thus, there’s a lot of space for creativity both in content and in presentation for this genre.</p>
<h2>Manga as a multimodal text</h2>
<p>It’s evident from the preview page and pictures on this webpage that manga is a medium of the visual mode. What’s more, manga basically imbues the visual mode with the other 4 (as described in chapter 1 of Writer/Designer) – aural, gestural, spatial and linguistic. As a person with personal experience of creating manga, I would argue that creating manga (like comic books) is actually <em>the</em> art of embodying of all these modes of communication within or through one – plain 2D A4/A5 black-white visual. I will be discussing all of this in details later, but just look at the page below if you feel like I’m exaggerating:</p>
<div class="mx-auto my-4 max-w-[40%]"><img src="/personal_website/images/page_15.jpg" alt="isn't this a real multimodal expression of the visual mode?" class="border h-full">
    </div>
<h2>Background for the chapter and Context (this one is very long)</h2>
<p>It’s truly confusing to read or analyze the chapter without the background, so I’ll give a brief and generalized explanation of the world setting and the characters.</p>
<p>In this world there’re humans and ghouls. Ghouls are practically monster-humans that feed on flesh (particularly, human flesh). They have much more of so-called “RC cells” that can be produced and excited to work like muscles and transform into different genetically-defined shapes outside of the body. Those muscles are called “kagune”. When not using kagune, ghouls look exactly like humans; but in arousal of RC cells ghouls’ eyes turn black and red (see the gif below). Ghouls also can regenerate and, sometimes, grow entire body shell (mutated kagune) using these cells (see <strong>Eto</strong>).</p>
<div class="mx-auto my-4 max-w-[40%]"><img src="/personal_website/images/a_ghoul.gif" alt="true beauty of Hinami" class="border h-full">
    <p class="text-center text-base">Hinami Fueguchi and her double kagune</p></div>
<p>There is also the CCG – a non-governmental organization that is “the ministry of dealing with ghouls”. It controls squads of specialists-investigators (wearing white suits) that carry out extermination of ghouls. These specialists wield artificially extracted and modified kagune (called “quinque”) to be on par with ghouls. There’s a <em>special</em> squad “Quinx” of investigators that were implanted with RC cell control system and quinque to become human-ghouls under the CCG. So far the CCG is at war with ghouls. Now, to the characters.</p>

<p><strong>Ken Kaneki</strong> – this guy is the main character. He was a human. He lived without parents for many years – father is unknown and mother died of overworking and emotional abuse by her sister. Ken said he loved his mother. He also had a single friend in school. After an accident he almost lost his life but was saved with a surgical operation. But during the operation RC cells of one ghoul were inserted into him, and he became a human-ghoul. He could no longer eat as humans (now only flesh). Since then, Ken struggled with understanding own nature and his place in the world – should he eat fellow-humans to survive, what about his friendship, is he human or not at all, does he represent either of the races or none? (By the way, this story is full of suffering). Then, he made friends with a few ghouls that became his family. Later, he was taken away and cruelly tortured until he became gray-haired and almost went crazy. Eventually he escaped and, indeed, grew more ruthless, sadistic and egoistic. Tokyo Ghoul ended as Ken was detained by “the Reaper” Kisho Arima after the CCG commenced an operation to eliminate Ken’s “family”. Just before the final battle, injured Ken stumbled upon his friend. Unexpectedly, his friend sacrificed own flesh so that Ken could regenerate; and no one has seen him since. The sequel started with Ken Kaneki becoming Haise Sasaki – a new personality with all memories of the past lost. Haise worked for CCG, mentoring the Quinx squad. He admired Kisho Arima and got a new family. For some time, Haise lived almost merrily in comparison to Ken. Even though his past was hidden from him, with time he began to remember bits of contradictory feelings. This way Haise met the young boy Ken with white hairs (see the pic.) in the sub consciousness for the first time. Haise initially was scared of his own ghoulish side and this boy, but eventually decided to learn more about Ken Kaneki.</p>

<p><strong>Shu Tsukiyama and Kanae (Karren) von Rosewald</strong> – Shu is the son of the head of an influential upper-class ghouls family, while Kanae was one of the family’s ghoul servants. For this chapter it is enough to now that, in the distant past, Kanae lost her family, changed gender and name, and then was sheltered <em>as a boy</em> by the Tsukiyama family (Shu is her cousin). So far we know that she loved Shu but concealed her feelings (and gender) from him for decades for the sake of not disturbing her master. Kanae was responsible for finding provision (humans) and once was almost captured by the CCG. Then she went missing. Just before this chapter, the CCG launched an extermination operation of the Tsukiyama family, and Haise came with other investigators to kill Shu and the servants. The operation took place in a high-rise building with CCG investigators gradually clearing floors one by one from the bottom. Shu waited at the roof for an escape by helicopter. Haise went directly to the roof, met Shu and almost killed him. Then Kanae suddenly appeared and intervened. Haise lost his hand, almost died but fought back with the help of a sudden surge of unintended Ken’s will.</p>
<div>picture</div>
<p><strong>Eto</strong> - is a powerful semi-ghoul (ghoul born from a human, hell yeah) with mutated RC cells that allow her to build-up artificial shell from kagune. Eto was the one who kidnapped, brainwashed and tortured Kanae (stitched her mouse and eyes alongside other things). Eto told her to stop concealing her desires and that killing Haise would bring Shu’s attention to her. In this chapter Eto appeared to watch the fight between Kanae and Haise.</p>
<div>picture</div>
<p><strong>Koori Ui and Hairu Ihei</strong> - Koori is a top-rank investigator, while Hairu was his partner. Koori was described as emotionally constrained, while Hairu was his opposite. Crucially, Koori spent a lot of time with Hairu. During the operation, Hairu lead her squad on the frontline. However, a few chapters ago Hairu’s squad engaged in a furious combat with two servants where she was beheaded. Meanwhile, Koori was fighting in a different place and, in this chapter, finally reached the place of her death.</p>
<h2>Summary of the chapter and Pre-iconography</h2>
<p>The summary as pre-iconography:</p>
<ol class="svelte-cnyx57"><li>Eto appeared in her shell and dealt a surprise attack on Haise.</li>
<li>She taunted him and then incited Kanae to continue the fight. Kanae was with stitched eyes and mouth.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Koori approached the place where Hairu was supposed to be and started obsessively naming metro stations. Background showed the stations and Hairu.</li>
<li>There was a frame with Koori and Hairu strolling down a street in the evening - Koori walking and Hairu skipping.</li>
<li>Next was a large frame of Koori in silence, then smaller frame of his hand squeezing the quinque.</li>
<li>He found and asked a survived investigator of the fight between Hairu’s squad and servants.</li>
<li>Scene changes to Haise. He was being beat up by Kanae while Eto was enjoying the scene.</li>
<li>Kanae hysterically repeated “I will be loved” while furiously kicking Haise’s head.</li>
<li>A single page showed how Shirazu fought another ghoul somewhere else in the building. (Shirazu is one of the Quinx that were mentored by Haise; “Sassan” is a shortened “Sasaki-san”, where “-san” is a Japanese suffix of politeness).</li>
<li>Haise appeared falling among ventilation, panels and walls of black and white square tiles.</li>
<li>Haise appeared lying on a tiled floor with young white-haired Ken over his head.</li>
<li>By the “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” approach (VD: Iconology), what happened next seems like complete non-sense – flying cubes, flowers, talk about death and salvation, two of them sitting on a tower and Ophiocordyceps sinensis emerging from Haise. Some text was black over white, the other was reversed, and the third was with stroke.</li>
<li>Finally, Haise’s hair and face started pouring with blood or something black, and the character awakened with blackened hairs and ghoul’s eye, pictured upside down.</li></ol>
<p>Naturally, there is a lot of implied meaning that the audience would easily understand without any explanation. For the sake of structure though, I consider it separately as a part of iconographical analysis. One last step before the analysis - understanding the purpose of this text.</p>
<h2>What’s the purpose of this text?</h2>
<p>In this chapter, Sui Ishida describes three different events that happen at the same time – Shirazu vs ghoul, Koori’s investigation and Kanae vs Haise. Most attention is given to Haise’s subconscious episode, and some to Koori. Given the context and summary, author mainly intended to thrust the story of Koori, Haise and Kanae. Audience – the readers of this manga – were expected to become more aware of these characters, feel more of their pain (actually, there’s just more and more pain to feel in this tragedy up until the end), be intrigued and influenced by characters’ explicit and implicit feelings. For example, readers are shown Kanae, at last, openly expressing her obsession and devotion to Shu through her (partly driven by Eto’s torture) vigorous impulsiveness and hate. Koori always looked like emotionless but, apparently, actually had affection and felt pain after found Hairu dead. Ken Kaneki reveals to himself that the mother he said to deeply care for actually abused him, but he used to block this memories. To make the effect, the visual narration must be profoundly expressive but not overwhelming. Furthermore, readers were supposed to understand that Ken’s true intentions in the final battle of Tokyo Ghoul was to die, heroically. Now, with Haise near death, Ken wants to try dying heroically again, and Haise drearily accepts the fact that, after all, he was just “a pleasant dream” covering multiple trauma; thus Haise Sasaki becomes Ken Kaneki again. Aside from surprising the readers, the author wanted readers to feel: Haise, a distinct personality, finally giving up oneself – being merged and, therefore, killed; and Ken, ultimately, returning consciousness with entirety of his dire past but in robust conviction. So, was the author effective in using iconography, semiotics and form in fulfilling this purpose?</p>
<h2>Iconographical and form analysis with semiotics</h2>

<p>Before the chapter, author includes two pages of contextual information about the CCG, ghouls and main characters of the volume (53th chapter is first in a volume). Given the time frame between producing volumes, this serves the purpose of reminding readers of the world setting and involved characters. It is clear that author effectively utilizes proximity (Universal Principles of Design [UPD], p.160), similarity (p. 184) and uniform connectedness (p. 200) to show relatedness between pages and content, but also division between ghouls and humans via inverted colors (humans with white background, ghouls with black). It can be said that there is the inherit perception bias against ghouls because white signifies “the good” and black “the bad”, although actually none of the characters fall under either category. This is probably unintentional because in eastern cultures white and black usually signify Yin and yang – the symbol of interconnectedness and interdependence. The author did not account for differences in culture (since people outside Japanese culture were not the author’s primary audience). Instead, using shades of gray or particular screentones would account for cultural differences.</p>
<h3 class="svelte-cnyx57">Emphasis and highlights</h3>
<p>Throughout the chapter, the original artists (and localizators) use color, shading and screentones, strokes and lines, highlights, fonts and font sizes, onomatopoeia and sound symbolism, text balloon shapes, layout and frame shapes and sizes to focus readers’ attention, bring feeling of motion, sound and space (thanks to three-dimensional projection, UPD, p. 194) to the visuals (in addition to invoking particular emotions). Below are several pages with my notes on this.</p>

<h3 class="svelte-cnyx57">Symbolic and implied meaning</h3>
<h4 class="svelte-cnyx57">Koori and Hairu</h4>
<div class="ml-4 max-w-[30%] float-right"><img src="/personal_website/images/page_11.jpg" alt="page 11" class="border h-full">
    </div>
<p>When Koori started naming stations (which is actually a small game in Japanese culture), he tried to distract himself from the surroundings and intrusive thought (of Hairu’s death that he was ready but really not ready for). He tried to substitute one intrusive thought with the other – the author expressed this as an enormous amount of text in the frames with one slipping frame of Hairu’s face, followed by another “distorted” one. In addition to appealing to the cultural common knowledge (the game), this page effectively demonstrates the character’s internal state.</p>
<p>Koori, however, was unsuccessful, which is implied by the usage of a large detailed flashback frame of him and Hairu. Given that readers know about Hairu’s death, seeing a serene picture of their joyful walk (joyfulness is signified by Hairu – she is skipping and naming a prominent Japanese multinational food processing company that makes sweets) might bring sorrow to them, since they can imagine or feel how Koori will mourn for such memories with Hairu.</p>
<div class="float-left mr-4 w-[25%]"><img src="/personal_website/images/page_12_edited.jpg" alt="page 12 edited" class="border h-full">
    </div>
<p>Another interesting point is that the author did not show Hairu’s dead body. There is a clear signifier – a large frame with a dramatic pause (big balloon with just an ellipsis) and a small frame of Koori’s hand squeezing his quinque (implied by the “SQZ”). What is signified is that Koori did found the body and, however he tried to suppress any emotions, some still leaked out. Koori was described as almost emotionless before this chapter. As an iconic interpretation, this depiction of his thoughts and reaction shows that, after all, he did have affection towards Hairu, her death is a blow to him, and he is not as emotionally restrained as it seemed.</p>
<h4 class="svelte-cnyx57">Kanae and Shu</h4>
<p>Meaning behind “I will be loved”</p>
<h4 class="svelte-cnyx57">Haise and Ken</h4>
<p>Meaning behind abstract space and black-white tiles: chaos, subconscious, labyrinth of mind and soul
Meaning behind the dialogue between Sasaki and white “soul” of Kaneki</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I have shown, this manga is overflowing with various design choices (form), signs and implicit meaning that can be uncovered with an iconographical analysis, all of which blends together into a soup of entertainment, story and art. Not all chapters are like this one, but I argue that this chapter has mostly effectively implemented semiotics, iconography and form to deliver its purpose.</p></div></section>
