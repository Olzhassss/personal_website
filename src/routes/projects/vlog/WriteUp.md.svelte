## Script

Writing for Digital Media… was an ambivalent experience. I enjoyed many things, but also was frustrated many times. [Intro]

Let’s start from what I learned. First and foremost, basic design and video editing. Among other reasons, I picked this course because I wanted to get closer to my cousin, Tolegen (our photo), who is an artist with vast experience in visual arts (showcase his works till the end of the paragraph), design and cinematography. He inspires me to learn more about his realm, and so touching basic design and video editing allowed me to make a step towards this pursuit (illustration of a step towards pursuit).
Secondly, a deeper understanding of digital media, multimodality, and semiotics now constitute a foundation for further research in this direction. I do not think that I want to associate my future with the premise of this course, but I do think that through this course I gained a significant amount of valuable experience. I am also proud of being versatile (well-rounded picture), and completing this course aligns with this perfectly.

Now, my frustration mainly comes from my experience with deadlines rather than the course content itself. See, I honestly enjoyed building my personal website (website), analyzing the piece of art I love for the blog entry (blog entry write up) and the other assignments (pop up on the screen or from the main page). The problem is - when you do what you like for a living it becomes a job (maybe illustration). This is what I do not like about formal education in general. I wish I could have more time for exploration and experimentation while working on assignments, but instead it was a (illustration) race against the deadlines all the way along. Unfortunately, there is practically nothing that could fix this under the current system of higher education. So, I believe there are two ways to be educated - under external pressure and under internal motivation. For this course (like for all the others), I feel like I was pressured more than motivated (fade out).

Not to end on a sad note, I would like to mention my experience with the assignments. The final project was… boring to me, frankly, because I ended up working alone on the website due to very bad timing of the military training (military training photo with caption "ended successfully"), and because, I guess, we chose not the most interesting client. The PSA is my least favorite (speed upped PSA), mainly since I somehow lost any motivation and interest in the topic of the assignment. I surely could have done much better under different circumstances. (Blog page scroll) Writing the blog was enjoyable (if I omit the fact that I did well above than was necessary and submitted late (Moodle recording)). Still, my analysis gives me all the more reasons to admire that piece of artwork (show cover). Lastly, my favorite work - digital narrative about my fictional love story. I like it because I, for once, did not struggle with deadlines, worked with my friends on filming, learned video editing, came up with this genius plot of mine and successfully materialized my ideas for the video.

Alright, this was my first ever blog video. Despite the pessimistic beginning of the vlog, my overall grade for this course is… Good. As a final note, I want to thank my professor James Nielsen for this semester, wish you all the best, and good luck with your nearest plans! Bye.
