## Write-up

Description of the video from YouTube:<br>
Everyone wants to be creative, confident and hopeful when confessing their feelings to someone. Same goes for me from the past, who, after many doubts, finally decided to express feelings... through a piano performance.

 - Genre: comedy
 - Theme: love

I divided my video into several parts and provided navigation for the write-up as follows:

 1.	[General reflections](#1)
 2.	[First scene](#2)
 3.	[At home, before slideshow](#3)
 4.	[Slideshow](#4)
 5.	[Practice](#5)
 6.	[Final scenes](#6)

### General reflections<span id="1"></span>
 
The assignment took quite a lot of effort and time, as expected. I knew that my habit of doing thorough think-through might overcomplicate everything, so I had to find a really simple idea and plot, yet it had to have a narrative with climax and resolution. I also tried to avoid filming outside of my home to save time, embed piano into the narrative and make the video as short as possible. When the final idea came to my mind with an approximate storyline, I mistakenly assumed it would make a 2 minute video. Eventually it took a lot more, and my idea also required me to use the piano room in the university, which is practically impossible to book and forbidden to use more than one hour straight. Fortunately for me, my friends agreed to come on Saturday very early in the morning when no booking is required (with low chance of the room being occupied), and we successfully made it in 1.5 hour. Everything else did not have strict time and space availability issues (except filming in the afternoon), so it was not stressful. In retrospect, I could have shortened the slideshow or my “learning” of the music piece, but I abandoned this idea to keep the narration comprehensive and less hasty. It might also be useful to add that I did not try to color the video because it did not serve any significant purpose in my mind and would rather distort the visuals.

### First scene<span id="2"></span>

So, the video starts with an introductory long-to-full shot with narration before the establishing shot. I used narration to explain the plot in parallel with action because it saves time. Both shots establish the setting around the video’s central venue – the piano room. The title is then displayed to be contrasted with the light floor color. I also aligned the cut with the music to provide smooth (fitting) transition. I used high-paced, lightweight, instrumental background music in accordance with the pace, mood and associations with a piano, correspondingly.

### At home, before slideshow<span id="3"></span>

<Image src="digital_narrative/static_show_behind_the_monitor.png" alt="Static frame behind the monitor" />

The static shot behind the monitor is filmed with wide angle because otherwise my face would be too close and space around me not clear. I admit that it might have been better not to show the back side of the monitor that much, which I considered when filming myself from this angle again later.

Some creativeness with picturing “the plan” assisted in smoothing transitions and explaining further actions, although cuts admittedly might be too short to read and understand the text for some people (I make assumption that the viewer can just pause the video if needed).

Along the way, I made a bad blooper and filmed myself with my watches. Unfortunately, highlighters used in the scene were borrowed and I did not have an opportunity to re-do the shot after noticing it. I then also noticed that the use of wide angle camera shots in sequence with front and main camera shots was not a very good idea since all of them, apparently, had different color perception and final video quality. I attempted to minimize differences with coloring, contrast, brightness and adjustment, but I remained unsatisfied with the result. (As a side note, quick cuts throughout the video were necessary mainly to save time and be interesting). Then, I also used a long shot from the furthest corner of my room (with my monitor in it) before the transition to the slideshow because it provided diversity (made the video more interesting) as well as some preparation for the cut (along with the fading background music). By invoking the sound of the mouse click, I wanted to associate the cut with my click on the website’s embedded video frame.

### Slideshow<span id="4"></span>

Thereafter, I filtered all slideshow photos with a standard “old film 2” video filter in the VSDC to make photos otherwise inconsistently colored photos fit together. Due to the length limit, all music excerpts are extremely short. As for the slides, they were not intended to be related with the music and served only as attention-drawing, high-quality visual imagery; although the filter conveniently made photos “warmer” to fit the theme of love.

</div>

### Practice<span id="5"></span>

A few cuts from a static angle and a split screen were applied when I "tried out" the piece just to add actions and showcase montage. Split screen was an interesting idea because I thought it’d be fun to watch the loading of the piano, but I needed more content on the screen so I juxtaposed my hands moving in preparation.

Series of short cuts were used to show my gradual (not without a struggle) learning quickly. Text on the screen was explicit in explaining the passage of time in addition to my appearance. I mostly changed my top to signify multiple study sessions and decided not to change the lights to avoid visual irritation from flashing. Similarly, constantly moving furniture would have distracted the viewers from the key actor. Also, to serve the comedy, I included a few shots of me lying on the floor.

### Final scenes<span id="6"></span>

Main point in the final scene is audio. Unfortunately, audio throughout the video, especially dialogues, was too quiet. I had to amplify the sound, but it also amplified and created noise. I tried filtering the noise, but it irreparably diminished the volume. Thus, the piano sound of my performance remained quieter than I would want.

The dialogues in the scenes were meant to be short and indirect. Even though this is a comedy, I attempted to keep serious tone here through silence (complete silence right before I started playing and no light background music otherwise) and such dialogues. I also included the piano sound during my “thoughts” before bracing up to dilute awkward silence. I did not intend to signify anything special by using the excerpt from the piece I played or the sound.

Final shot from outside the door is purposely similar to the first shot in the video. It provides good “distraction” for the last monolog by also showcasing the fact that it’s a happy ending with both characters enjoying their time.

Cut to credits is a reference to a renowned meme “Directed by Robert B. Weide” that I applied to emphasize comedic content of the final phrase and the story as a whole. To be consistent, I then decided to use “Claredon” font not just for credits, but everywhere else as well.

### Conclusion

To conclude, I enjoyed the assignment, learned and tried out new things about pre-, post-production of a film. The film isn’t perfect, but I definitely learned from my mistakes.
