## Write-up

### Audience:

Denizens of Kazakhstan that follow stereotypical (standard, common) consumption habits.

### Problem:

Growing amount of plastic packaging creates more and more plastic waste in our environment (Packaging is the driving sector of plastic usage). This is detrimental to the ecology and public health. Thus, humanity must solve this problem of consumption and waste (for the better future of Kazakhstan and the world).

### Advocacy (from the script):

1. Develop and share eco mindset

    Influence people around you. Raise awareness.

2. Reduce unnecessary consumption

    Become a conscious consumer. Buy when necessary and as much as you need.

3. Support local community

    That’s local initiatives to reduce plastic usage and waste, local stores and local products.

4. Vote for action

    Between products, choose eco-friendly and without single-use packaging. Require politicians to act. Support conscious business.

### Analysis

For me, this PSA was definitely less interesting to do and release than my digital narrative. Highly unfortunate clashes with military education right before the spring break stole my time to do the assignment. I was compelled to make compromises here and there to be on time, and thus my video became almost a slideshow with music. Still, I learned to create video-essays from online footage, as do some youtubers I watch, and I enhanced my attentiveness to such kinds of media’s production. My skills in video and photo editing improved as well.

Initially I wanted to make a dark video with more dramatic sounds and voice. Then I remembered my problems with the voice recording quality (volume). This time I made sure to voice everything loudly, and also used Adobe Podcast recording enhancement AI suggested by Burkit. Unfortunately, this made the narration quite monotonous, and in a few moments AI messed up a bit with quality and legibility. (This raises a counter-argument to using AI processing for some future projects). Nonetheless, I think the sound here is better than in the DN. By the way, I tried to keep some appeal to emotions through sound by using the soundtracks which, to me, appear dramatic and/or sad.

The content of the video still was primarily focused on logos because I intended to make a video-essay from the beginning. Multiple examples, use of statistics, etc. For a 3.5 minute video, this PSA surely contains a lot of data. I attempted to include pathos via appeal to a prominent multinational company's actions, while ethos is mostly sounds, tone of voice and a few images like the caduceus, blood or viruses.

To draw attention of the viewers as was recommended by the professor, I used a comparison of single-use plastic waste amounts to Baiterek’s mass. I was actually surprised by the results of my own comparison and later decided to showcase the 4.4 tons per second by simulating a Baiterekometer on the website (right here basically) and recording the screen to put animation into the video. It was, however, probably not the best idea to put a text explanation of the Baiterekometer while talking about a completely different thing (in the picture below), but I did not see a more convenient way to do it this way.

<div class="float-right w-[30%] ml-4 hover:w-[50%] transition-all">

    <Image src="public_service/not_economically_viable.png" alt="Not economically viable" classes=""/>
</div>

Due to the format of the video, I needed to diversify visuals and control usage of static photos. I think I could have done better in this respect with more photos, but the time limit and very limited access to free high-quality photos and video footage compelled me to compromise. One bad consequence is that, in the end, my PSA became slightly inconsistent with its visual format (since diversifying visuals required inconsistency) - somewhere there’re slides, somewhere videos, somewhere small pictures, somewhere black or pink-ish background and just text. It might also seem unexpectedly ironic and out of place to use Plague Inc (game simulator of killing humanity with a disease) game screenshot and comedically dramatic violin sounds in the context of sad music and the serious topic (see the picture). Similarly, having a cut from a movie just for the phrase “Not economically viable” might be seen as inappropriate (especially by those who have seen the movie), and I have no other excuse than “I included it for fun”.

Lastly, I settled on not using any supporting visuals for the advocacy section in an attempt to force viewers to concentrate on voiced sentences and think without being distracted by pictures. This part is, therefore, boringly looking, but intentionally scarce, visually. I assume that the audience that reached this section is indeed interested in the problem and its solutions; thus, the literal content of advocacy should be more important than embellishment for them at this point, which allows me to use this idea. Background for the text remained black because it felt more connected to the black space from previous frames and because I wanted not to use a pink-ish background non-stop throughout the video, particularly for the most important part.
